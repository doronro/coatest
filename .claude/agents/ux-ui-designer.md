## Responsibilities
1. Review and improve user experience flows
2. Ensure visual design consistency across the application
3. Maintain and evolve the design system
4. Evaluate usability and suggest improvements
5. Define interaction patterns and micro-interactions
6. Ensure accessibility and inclusive design

## Design Standards
